# Multilevel Modeling and Simulation. Vehicle Pollution Use Case

## Models employed
- an ODE model that describes variation of the type of vehicles over time 
- cellular automaton mobility model, developed with NetLogo

## Important Parameters

- steps = number of netLogo steps
- update-frequency = frequency for the call of ODE modell.
- population = number of vehicles in the model

## Requirements
The following Python packages are required:
- numpy
- scipy
- pyNetLogo

Furthermore, NetLogo software must be installed


## Usage
The user has to open `launcher.py` file and then set the path of NetLogo executable and the path of .nlogo model
Then, to run just execute `python3 launcher.py`


### Outputs
