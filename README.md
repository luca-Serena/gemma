# GEMMA (GEneric Multilevel Modeling Abstraction)

GEMMA is a general purpose metamodel for mo√¨ultilevel modeling and simulation, designed to be adaptable to any modeling framework where multiple components interact. The objective is to support developers during the design phase of a multilevel simulator by providing a systematic approach for structuring multilevel systems and describing interactions between sub-models.
GEMMA is composed of the following elements:

- **M** is the set of atomic models
    
- **T** is the top-level component, which acts as the interface for the user, and provides a starting point for execution.
    
- **S** describes how levels are structured. It can be represented as a rooted tree, where the root is **T**, and the other nodes are elements of **M**. Each node is responsible for coordinating the execution of its descendants, if any. 
    
- **P** is the set of parameters of the model.
    
- **C**is the set of conditions that are used by a component to call an underlying component.
    
- **I** is the set of inputs to provide when a model is called.
    
- **O** is the set of outputs of the called model.
    
- **L** is the set of policies to maintain consistency. 
    
- **R** is the set of outputs of the model.

## Use cases
Two simple illustrative use cases are presented to prove the feasability of GEMMA
 - A pollution model where different types of vehicles emit local pollution within the considered environment
 . A smart territory model where vehicles act as data mule to carry sensor data in areas without Internet connection
